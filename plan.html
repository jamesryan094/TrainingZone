  <p>James Ryan: JC245729</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>Provide a website that will bring about an increase in sales (one that can be attributed to the website)</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> A measure of the store's sales will recorded at project commencement and again at project completion. <br>
The difference in sales will be compared to (and theoretically, roughly equate) the site's traffic.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Age Range:28 - 50 <br>
seeking to educate/better themselves <br>
(green has been found to imply &quot;growth&quot;, so lots of that then)<br>
    Frankly: our client is looking for a customer (more than usual), the customer (user) is looking for a job
